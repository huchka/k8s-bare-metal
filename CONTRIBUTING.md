# Contributing to k8s-bare-metal

## Development Workflow

This project follows a structured SDLC. All tracking lives on GitHub.

### For issues that need design (`phase:design`)

1. **Write the design** — choose the right level based on size and complexity:
   - **`size:L` or multi-issue epics**: wiki page using the [Design Doc Template](https://github.com/huchka/k8s-bare-metal/wiki/Design-Doc-Template). Use when there are meaningful tradeoffs or architectural decisions worth referencing later.
   - **`size:M` with tradeoffs**: wiki page or inline in the issue body — use judgment.
   - **`size:S` or obvious approach**: inline in the issue body. No wiki page needed.
2. **Self-review** the design (re-read the next day for non-trivial work)
3. **Update the issue** with the wiki link (if applicable) and change label from `phase:design` → `phase:ready`
4. **Move the issue** from "Backlog" → "Ready for Dev" on the [project board](https://github.com/users/huchka/projects/2)

### For issues ready to implement (`phase:ready`)

1. **Move to "In Progress"** on the project board
2. **Create a branch** from `main`: `feat/N-short-description`, `fix/N-short-description`, or `infra/N-short-description`
3. **Implement** — write tests alongside code
4. **Commit** using conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `infra:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
5. **Push branch and open a PR** using the PR template. Reference the issue with `Closes #N`
6. **Self-review** the PR diff before merging
7. **Merge to main**
8. **Deploy** and verify in the target environment
9. **Move to "Done"** on the project board

## Project Board

[k8s-bare-metal Project](https://github.com/users/huchka/projects/2)

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Backlog | Not yet planned or needs design |
| Ready for Dev | Design done, ready to implement |
| In Progress | Actively being worked on |
| In Review | PR open, awaiting review |
| Done | Merged and verified |

## Labels

| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `type:feature` | New functionality |
| `type:bug` | Something broken |
| `type:chore` | Infra, refactor, CI/CD |
| `type:docs` | Documentation only |
| `priority:high` | Do next |
| `priority:medium` | Planned |
| `priority:low` | Backlog filler |
| `phase:design` | Needs design before dev |
| `phase:ready` | Design done, ready to implement |
| `size:S` | ~1-2 hours |
| `size:M` | ~half day |
| `size:L` | ~1+ days |

## Branch Naming

```
feat/N-short-description
fix/N-short-description
infra/N-short-description
```

Where `N` is the GitHub issue number.

## Design Docs

- Live on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/huchka/k8s-bare-metal/wiki)
- Use the [Design Doc Template](https://github.com/huchka/k8s-bare-metal/wiki/Design-Doc-Template)
- Link from the corresponding GitHub issue
- **Not every issue needs a wiki page.** Only create one when there are architectural decisions or tradeoffs worth documenting for future reference. For straightforward tasks, design inline in the issue body.
